                            <h3>AVATAR: WAY OF THE WATER</h3>
    <p>Avatar: The Way of Water picks up over a decade after the events of the first film. Jake Sully is now fully integrated into the Na’vi, 
        living peacefully with Neytiri and their growing family in the forests of Pandora. However, their lives are disrupted when the "Sky People" 
        (humans) return to Pandora, this time with a new and more aggressive colonization plan.
        To protect their family and the Na'vi people, Jake and Neytiri flee with their children to the Metkayina clan, a sea-dwelling Na’vi tribe. 
        As they learn the ways of the water — a new way of life closely tied to the ocean and its creatures — the Sully family must confront new threats,
         both from within and outside.      
        The film dives deep into family, survival, and belonging, with visually stunning underwater sequences and expanded world-building that explores the 
        beauty and danger of Pandora’s oceans.</p>
