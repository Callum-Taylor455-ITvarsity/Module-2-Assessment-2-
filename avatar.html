                            <h3>AVATAR</h3>
    <p>Avatar is a sci-fi epic set in the mid-22nd century on Pandora, a lush, habitable moon orbiting 
        a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The story follows Jake Sully, a paraplegic former 
        Marine who is selected to participate in the Avatar Program, which allows humans to remotely 
        control bioengineered bodies — or "avatars" — that resemble the native Na'vi people.
        Jake's mission is to help a human corporation extract unobtanium, a valuable mineral, from Pandora. 
        But as he spends time with the Na'vi, particularly Neytiri, he becomes immersed in their culture and 
        begins to question his allegiance. Torn between duty and conscience, Jake ultimately sides with the Na'vi 
        in their fight to protect their land from destruction.</p>
