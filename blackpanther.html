                            <h3>BLACK PANTHER</h3>
    <p>After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king — and as the Black Panther, 
        the nation's masked protector. Wakanda is a technologically advanced but secretive country, powered by vibranium, a rare and powerful metal.
        T'Challa's reign is soon challenged by Erik Killmonger, a ruthless and driven outsider with a personal vendetta and a vision to use Wakanda’s 
        resources to liberate oppressed people around the world by force. T'Challa must face the legacy of his father’s decisions, confront Killmonger's challenge, 
        and determine what kind of king — and man — he wants to be.   
        The film is celebrated not only for its action and world-building but also for its cultural impact, themes of identity, legacy, and global responsibility.</p>
