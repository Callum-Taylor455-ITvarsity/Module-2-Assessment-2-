                            <h3>THE AVENGERS</h3>
    <p>Now publicly known as Iron Man, Tony Stark faces pressure from the U.S. government to hand over his advanced suit technology, 
        fearing it could be weaponized by enemies. Meanwhile, his health is deteriorating due to the palladium core that powers his arc reactor.
        As Tony struggles with his mortality and legacy, a new threat emerges: Ivan Vanko, a brilliant but vengeful Russian inventor, who creates 
        his own arc-powered weaponry to take down Iron Man. At the same time, weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer tries to outdo Stark and exploits Vankoâ€™s 
        skills for his own gain.
        With the help of his best friend James "Rhodey" Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor), assistant Pepper Potts, and the mysterious Natasha Romanoff 
        (aka Black Widow), Tony must face both his inner demons and external enemies to protect what matters most.</p>
